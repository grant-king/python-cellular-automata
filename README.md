# python-cellular-automata
A small library for configuring, viewing, and recording cellular automata simulations with Python.

## About PCA
This project is made to provide Python programmers with a way to visualize and record 2D cellular automata.

This project relies most on Pygame to visualize and handle user control. It also uses NumPy for array operations, Numba for GPU processing, and opencv-python to capture and process image data. It is capable of running very slowly on just a CPU, but is meant to be run on CUDA-enabled GPUs.

## Installation
To use this library you will first have to install the prerequisite packages:

--> Pygame

--> OpenCV-Python

--> NumPy

--> Numba

Clone this repository with git and use the command prompt to navigate to the folder containing hello_ca.py

Run hello_ca.py with python: `..\python-cellular-automata\pythoncellularautomata> python hello_ca.py`

## Basic Usage
Open hello_ca.py or any of the example files in your text editor to explore the example configuration templates.

Each new automaton needs
